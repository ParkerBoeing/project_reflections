# M1 Project Reflections

## Warmup Project 

### Project Overview

#### List out the tools you used:
1. Ruby
2. Rspec
3.
...

#### Write a 1-2 sentence synopsis of what this project does:
  - This project builds out flashcards and checks given answers against correct answers. The flashcard program then gives proper feedback depending on answers given.

### Reflection Questions: 
**1. How do you approach solving something when you don’t have all the information?**<br />
  - Google
  - Go back through old lessons / projects to see if I missed anything
  - Ask a friend / post in code help
**2. What was your most effective strategy for getting through blockers during this project? How did this help your process?**<br />
  - My most effective strategy for getting through blockers on this project was to take breaks. This allowed my brain to reset and think about problems differently instead of getting stuck in the same thought pattern.
**3. Tell us about a time that you found yourself in an unproductive struggle, how did you get out of it?**<br />
  - For this project I rarely hit unproductive struggles and mostly just found myself slowing down. I feel like searching for solutions is equivalent to meandering through lots of cobwebs. For each cobweb I break through I get slowed down a bit and if I don't take the time to clear off the webs I start to feel overly bogged down. The solution for this is to take breaks that allow me to reset my brain, which oftentimes meant just lying down with my eyes closed.
**4. What was the benefit of using TDD while building out this project?**<br />
  - I really enjoyed getting to utilize TDD while building out this project and can see numerous benefits. One of which is that it allowed me to more acccurately pinpoint errors in my code and fix them before moving on.
## First Solo

### Project Overview

#### List out the tools you used:
1. Ruby
2. Rspec
3.
...

#### Write a 1-2 sentence synopsis of what this project does:
 - This project uses a linked list on Ruby to create a series of nodes, each containing beats. The operator can then run the beats through the terminal, utilizing different rates and voices, to create a series of sounds.


### Reflection Questions: 
**1. Pick 1 technical concept you used for this project (look back at our lessons and the learning goals of the project to pick this). Explain what this concept is, how it works, and give an example of where you used this in your code.**<br />
 - There are many technical concepts I used for this project that I would love to dive into, but for the sake of this response I'll choose the technique I leaned on the most heavily, the while loop. The while loop performs a function until a given circumstance is reached. I used this loop over and over in my code, oftentimes to traverse the linked list by saying "while another node still exists" or "while the counter is less than the index given," perform X function (often in these scenarios that function was to set the current node as pervious node, next node to current node, and build in pointers connecting all the nodes).
**2. What was your process when you got stuck?**<br />
 - There were three things I would do when I got stuck and it usually went in this order.
    - Use pry to go into the code and see what was happening
    - Pore over the lines that the error messages point to
    - Google using key words from the error messages
    - Phone a friend! Reach out to classmates, mentors, rocks, etc.
**3. If you had to do this project again, what would you do differently and why?**<br />
  - This one is easy, if I had to do this project again I would like to play with it more! I basically ran out of time. Each iteration took me a long time to build and understand, so I spent most of my time working on ensuring functionality and very little time getting to tinker with the code and play with alternative ways of writing the same code.
